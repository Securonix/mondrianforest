Description: This package contains R functions that build and predict 
    (classification only right now) with Mondrian Forests 
    [Lakshminarayanan et al. 2014], an online machine learning model 
    inspired by random forests. The package implements a few 
    modifications to the original algorithm including a scheme to 
    dummy-encode categorical variables and a faster ExtendMondrianBlock 
    algorithm that retains online properties.
