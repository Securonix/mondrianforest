# mondrianforest

This is the home page of my R implementation of the Mondrian forest algorithms introduced in [Lakshminarayanan at al., 2014](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~balaji/mondrian_forests_nips14.pdf). Mondrian forest is an online alternative to random forest. So far, it only supports classification. Please see the vignette for examples and explanations of its behavior.
